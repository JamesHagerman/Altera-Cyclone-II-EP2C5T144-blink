-- This is the start of an "ENTITY"
library ieee; -- This is important. basically tells the compiler we're onboard with ieee
use ieee.std_logic_1164.all;
ENTITY compare8 IS PORT(
	x, y: IN	std_logic_vector(7 DOWNTO 0) ; -- two, 8 bit inputs, lsb
	res: OUT	std_logic ); -- one binary output
END compare8;

-- Now we must define the actual "ARCHITECTURE" for this "ENTITY"
-- This is how the entity actually works:
ARCHITECTURE struct OF compare8 IS
BEGIN
	res <= '1' WHEN (x = y) ELSE '0';
END struct;
-- And that's it! Our very first, useless, 8bit compare function.
